## Introduction
This document describes how to setup an ODBC link between **R** and the local NASIS database. See [Chapter 2](http://ncss-tech.github.io/stats_for_soil_survey/chapters/2_data/2a_tabular_data.html) from the Statistics for Soil Scientists training for a demonstration.

## Open the ODBC Data Source Administrator
1. Go to the Start Menu and search for 'ODBC'. See [this page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms188691.aspx) if you get lost. Select the 64-bit ODBC application if you are using Windows 10. It should look like this:

2. With the "User DSN" tab selected, create a new data source by clicking on the "Add..." button. 
  + Select the "SQL Server Native Client 11.0" driver.
  
  
![](odbc-02.png)
  
  + Name the data source `nasis_local`. The data source description is optional.

![](odbc-03.png)
  
  + The NASIS SQL server name is in the format `XXXXXX\NASISSQLEXPRESS`, where `XXXXXX` is the ["computer name" of your local machine](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-your-computer-name) and `NASISSQLEXPRESS` is the local NASIS SQL Express server.
  
  + Your computer name is often on the asset tag sticker on the outside of your computer. 
  
  + On Windows 10, you can view your computer name by opening the _Control Panel_ and selecting "System" _OR_ by searching "This PC" in the _Start Menu_, right-clicking it, and selecting "Properties" . You need the value found under "Computer name:" (highlighted below).
    
![](odbc-06.png)
  
  + Your computer name will look something like: `ARCCASON5000002` -- where state, office and number will vary from computer to computer. _Be very careful when typing it in!_ This is a common source of error in setting up ODBC connection. You will have something like _Server:_ `ARCCASON5000002\NASISSQLEXPRESS` as entered on the form above.

When finished click "Next".

3. Under "Create a New Data Source to SQL Server" choose the second option: "SQL Server authentication..." <br>**don't try and re-type these, just copy/paste**
  + login: `NASISSQLRO` 
  + Windows 7 password: `nasisRe@d0n1y`
  + Windows 10 password: `nasisRe@d0n1y365`

4. On the next screen, select "Nasis-local" as the default database. The connection you will be making is `READONLY`.

5. Click "Next" and then "Finish". If you would like, you can test the connection to make sure it works.

6. Close the ODBC control panel by clicking 'OK'

## Optionally Install Required Packages

For the demonstration below, you will need to install the `RODBC` and `soilDB` R packages [if you have not already]. 

You can check by trying to load either of these packages in the console using `library(RODBC)` for instance. 

Install RODBC and other soil-themed packages using the commands below if you are unsure.

```{r install-packages, eval=FALSE}
# stable version from CRAN + dependencies
install.packages("RODBC", dep=TRUE)

# stable version from CRAN + dependencies
install.packages("aqp", dep=TRUE)
install.packages("soilDB", dep=TRUE)
install.packages("sharpshootR", dep=TRUE)

# latest version off GitHub
remotes::install_github("ncss-tech/aqp", dependencies=FALSE, upgrade=FALSE, build=FALSE)
remotes::install_github("ncss-tech/soilDB", dependencies=FALSE, upgrade=FALSE, build=FALSE)
remotes::install_github("ncss-tech/sharpshootR", dependencies=FALSE, upgrade=FALSE, build=FALSE)
```

## An example R session

After installing the above packages, add some *sites+pedons* or *components* into the selected set in NASIS.

Then, try loading them into your R session.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
# load required libraries
library(aqp)
library(soilDB)

# fetch all pedons from the selected set in local NASIS database
x <- fetchNASIS(from='pedons')

# make sketches of the first 10 pedons
par(mar=c(0,0,0,0))
plot(x[1:pmin(length(x), 10), ], name='hzname', label='taxonname')
```

Good job, that wasn't so hard. 

Now is a good time to check out [some of the tutorials on the AQP website](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/).

Details on loading NASIS data into R can be found in [this tutorial](http://ncss-tech.github.io/AQP/soilDB/fetchNASIS-mini-tutorial.html).
